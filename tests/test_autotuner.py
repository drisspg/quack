def test_compile_worker_watchdog_terminates_orphan(tmp_path):
    """Spawn a worker that arms the watchdog and busy-sleeps; verify the
    worker exits after the parent dies, *and* that the only way it can
    exit is via the watchdog.

    The previous version of this test went through the real worker's
    ``cw.main()`` loop and connected stdin to a ``subprocess.PIPE``. When
    the parent (the inner ``parent.py`` script) exited, the OS closed the
    pipe's write end, the worker's ``_recv(stdin)`` returned ``None``, and
    the worker exited via the normal "stdin EOF -> break" path — *without*
    ever needing the watchdog. That made the test a false positive: it
    passed even with the watchdog disabled.

    To genuinely exercise the watchdog, the spawned 'worker' here is a
    minimal inline script that:
      * imports ``quack._compile_worker``,
      * sets ``_WATCHDOG_POLL_SECS`` to a small value for test speed,
      * sets ``QUACK_COMPILE_WORKER_PARENT_PID`` to its parent's pid,
      * calls ``_install_parent_watchdog()``, then
      * blocks in ``time.sleep(120)``.

    This script does NOT go through ``cw.main()``. There is no stdin read
    that could complete on EOF. The only thing that can terminate the
    sleep is ``os.kill(self, SIGKILL)`` from the watchdog thread.

    Sequence:
      1. Test process T spawns ``parent.py`` (process P).
      2. P spawns the busy-sleep worker W with
         ``QUACK_COMPILE_WORKER_PARENT_PID = P.pid`` and stdin=DEVNULL
         (so even if anything ever read stdin, it wouldn't be a P-owned
         pipe).
      3. P writes W's pid to disk and exits.
      4. T polls for W's death. The watchdog must fire within ~10 s.
